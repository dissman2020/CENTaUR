**Important:** Note that code is quite outdated already. It is mainly for reference purposes and I would not recommend working with it directly. If you are interested in this research, I would instead forward you to this [tutorial paper](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/f7stn) and [code](
https://github.com/Zak-Hussain/LLM4BeSci), which contains a [simplified  version of this project](https://github.com/Zak-Hussain/LLM4BeSci/tree/main/choice) using the huggingface library.
